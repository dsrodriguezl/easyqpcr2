# easyqpcr2

<!-- badges: end -->

Rebuild of the abandoned EasyqpcR package, from Bioconductor (V 2.12).  
As EasyqpcR, this package is intended for the analysis of low-throughput 
real-time quantitative PCR data, based on the qBase algorithms published by
Hellemans et al. in 2007. 

Several functions were modyfied to be able to work with the newest version of R,
and/or to add extra functionalities to them. New versions of the original
functions state that they are modified of an original EasyqpcR function, and of
which, in their descriptions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of easyqpcr2 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dsrodriguezl/easyqpcr2"
  , dependencies = TRUE
  , build_vignettes = TRUE)
